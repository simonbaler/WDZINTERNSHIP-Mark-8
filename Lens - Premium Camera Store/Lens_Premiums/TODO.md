# Code Restructuring for BTech Student Style

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Edit main.tsx - add casual comments, rename variables to be more informal
- [x] Edit App.tsx - add student-like comments, maybe some unused imports or casual structure
- [x] Edit backend/index.js - add console.logs, casual comments, make data handling less efficient
- [x] Edit package.json - add some student comments if possible (JSON doesn't allow comments)
- [x] Review and edit a few key components to add student touches (edited spinner.tsx)
- [x] Test that everything still works after changes (build successful)

## Student Code Characteristics to Add:
- Casual comments like "// this is the main entry point"
- Abbreviated variable names (rootEl instead of rootElement)
- Console.logs left in for debugging
- Some redundant code
- Informal structure
- Less optimized approaches
