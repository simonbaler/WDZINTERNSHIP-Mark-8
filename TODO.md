# TODO: Add Comment Lines Across Project Code Files

## Steps

1. Add file-level, function-level, and inline comments to `src/pages/Auth.tsx` to improve code readability.
2. Add comments to other key pages in `src/pages/` directory following the pattern used in `Auth.tsx`.
3. Add comments to custom hooks in `src/hooks/` directory (e.g. `useAuth.ts`, `useToast.ts`).
4. Add comments to components in:
   - `src/components/`
   - `src/components/admin/`
   - `src/components/cart/`
   - `src/components/category/`
   - `src/components/chat/`
   - `src/components/features/`
   - `src/components/layout/`
   - `src/components/product/`
   - `src/components/products/`
   - `src/components/search/`
   - `src/components/ui/`
5. Add comments to backend route files in `backend/routes/` (e.g. `products.js`).
6. Add comments to key files in backend root and src (e.g. `backend/server.js`).
7. Review and refine comments to maintain consistent style and clarity across files.

## Notes:
- Avoid commenting on non-code files such as assets, config files, JSON data, or markdown documentation.
- Focus on providing useful context for maintainers and readers.
- Ensure comments are clear, concise, and reflect the code intent.

Once each step is complete, seek confirmation before proceeding to next.
